# TickTick+ for Omarchy

**Your TickTick lists in the Omarchy bar.** Choose what the panel opens on
— Today, the next week, the next month, or one of your lists — browse every
list and folder, reschedule, move and filter tasks, and keep habits and a
focus timer alongside.

Forked from [sotoaugusto/omarchy-ticktick](https://github.com/SotoAugusto/omarchy-ticktick)
0.5.2, which did the hard work of talking to TickTick; see
[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).

The bar shows the checklist glyph with up to three dots down its left side:

| Dot | Where | Means |
|---|---|---|
| red | top | something is overdue |
| blue | middle | something is due today |
| green | bottom | something is due in the next seven days, after today |

The dots cover every list, whatever the panel is showing, and the glyph
never changes colour or grows a number. Hover it for the counts. Left click
opens the panel.

## Features

- **Show first**: open the panel on a date range (Today, Tomorrow, Week,
  Month), a smart list (All, No date, Inbox), a list, or a folder — set it
  in `shell.json` or with the ★ in the panel header
- **Lists and folders**: the view picker mirrors TickTick's sidebar, with
  each list's colour and folders indented
- **Reschedule and move**: Today, Tomorrow, +7 days, pick a date, clear the
  date, set priority, or move to another list — from `m` or a right-click
  on the row. A reschedule keeps the task's time of day
- **Group and sort**: group by date, list, priority or nothing; sort by
  due, priority, title or TickTick's manual order
- **Filter** by tag or minimum priority, for the session
- **Quick add follows the view**: typed into a list, the task lands in that
  list; typed into Tomorrow, it is due tomorrow
- Everything the upstream plugin did: edit in place, subtasks, habits with
  streaks, an undo window, due notifications, offline outbox, and a focus
  timer that logs to TickTick

## Requirements

| Dependency | Required | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Omarchy 4 (Quattro) with Quickshell | yes | the shell that hosts the plugin |
| `python3` | yes | the CLI; standard library only, no pip packages |
| `curl` | no | not used — the CLI speaks HTTP through `urllib` |
| `notify-send` (libnotify) | no | only for due notifications, which are off by default |
| A TickTick account | yes | free accounts work; habits need TickTick's own habit feature |

No external Python packages, no build step, and nothing is compiled.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/design-nexus/omarchy-ticktick-plus.git --enable
```

That clones it into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/design-nexus.ticktick/` and
puts the widget on the bar. If you copied the folder there yourself instead:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin enable design-nexus.ticktick --section right
```

If the upstream plugin is installed, put this one in its place and switch the
old one off:

```bash
omarchy plugin enable design-nexus.ticktick --section right --before io.github.sotoaugusto.ticktick
omarchy plugin disable io.github.sotoaugusto.ticktick
```

**Existing login.** On first run the CLI borrows the upstream plugin's session
from `~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick/session.json`, so there is nothing to
paste. It keeps its own cache, outbox and session under
`~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus/` from then on, so the two plugins never
write over each other's files.

**Fresh setup.** Otherwise click the widget. It shows a plug icon until it
is connected, and clicking it opens a setup card with three steps and a paste
field:

1. Open `ticktick.com` and sign in
2. `F12` → **Application** → **Cookies** → `https://ticktick.com`
3. Copy the value of the cookie named **`t`**, paste it, press Connect

The field is masked, the token is handed to the CLI through a file in a
`0700` directory rather than on a command line, and the file is deleted as
soon as it is read. Nothing reads your browser.

If you would rather stay in a terminal:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/design-nexus.ticktick/bin/omarchy-ticktick login --token -
```

`--token -` prompts with the input hidden, so the credential stays out of
your shell history. `logout` leaves a marker behind rather than deleting the
session outright, so a later run does not quietly borrow the upstream token
again.

## Removal

```bash
omarchy plugin remove design-nexus.ticktick
```

That disables the widget, drops its entry from `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`,
and deletes the plugin directory. Two things live outside it and are left
behind on purpose, because they are your data and your credential:

```bash
omarchy-ticktick logout                     # forget the token + keyring entry
rm -rf ~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus      # remove the cache and session file
```

Run `logout` **before** removing the plugin if you want the keyring entry
cleared too — the CLI is what knows how to clear it, and removal deletes the
CLI. Nothing in TickTick itself is touched: no tasks, habits, or focus
sessions are deleted by uninstalling.

## About the API

TickTick's documented Open API (v1, OAuth) has **no habits endpoint at all**.
It covers projects and tasks and nothing else. This plugin therefore speaks
the same private v2 API the TickTick web app uses, authenticated with a
session token.

That is a deliberate trade and you should know what you are taking on:

- It is undocumented. TickTick can change or break it without notice.
- Scripted password login is unreliable and risky. `/api/v2/user/signon`
  answers a *correct* password with `username_password_not_match` when its
  risk control does not recognise the client, and repeated attempts get the
  account flagged. Use the browser token.
- The edge rejects requests that imitate the web app too closely. Sending
  `Origin`/`Referer`, or the full `x-device` object from TickTick's own
  bundle, returns `access_forbidden`; a minimal `x-device` is what works.
- No password is written to disk. Only the session token is, at
  `~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus/session.json`, mode 0600.
- `/api/v2/user/signin` — the path several published wrappers still use — is
  a dead 404. The live one is `/user/signon`.

Sessions expire eventually. When one does the panel returns to its setup card
and asks for a fresh token. There is no automatic renewal: it would need a
stored password, and TickTick refuses scripted password logins anyway, so the
machinery would sit there unable to do the one thing it exists for.

Using TickTick's Chinese service instead? Set `TICKTICK_DOMAIN=dida365.com`.

## How it fits together

The shell never talks to TickTick. `bin/omarchy-ticktick` owns the session
and every request, and writes a cache to
`~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus/data.json`. `Panel.qml` watches that file
and shells back out for writes. So a long-lived credential stays out of the
shell process, and every mutation is one command you can run yourself.

```
bin/omarchy-ticktick   session, API calls, the JSON cache
Model.js               task filtering, due labels, habit streaks (node-testable)
Service.qml            everything that must exist once, not once per screen
Panel.qml              the popup — a view of the service
BarWidget.qml          the bar slot
```

### Multiple monitors

A bar surface is created per monitor, so the widget and its panel exist once
per screen. Anything stateful left in the panel is therefore duplicated, and
that is not merely wasteful: two focus clocks each upload the block they
finish, inflating the very statistics the timer exists to keep honest.

`Service.qml` is a `service`-kind plugin, which the shell mounts exactly once
and hands to views through `shell.serviceFor(id)` — the same arrangement the
first-party media plugin uses. It owns the cache, the sync timer, the write
queue, the undo window, and the focus clock. The panels render it and keep
only what is genuinely per-screen, such as which date range that screen is
showing.

Panel routing is the bar's job, not the plugin's. A widget lives once per
monitor, but an IPC target resolves to a single handler, so a keybind used to
open the panel on whichever instance registered first. The bar already
answers this for `shell.summon` by asking Hyprland which output is focused,
so the plugin's own IPC calls borrow that resolution rather than acting
locally.

Two things stay defensive even so, because separate processes are involved:
delivery of the outbox runs under an exclusive lock, and timer-driven syncs
pass `--max-age` so a sync another process just finished is not repeated.

### CLI

```bash
omarchy-ticktick login --token -            # paste the browser's `t` cookie
omarchy-ticktick login [--email ADDR]          # password fallback
omarchy-ticktick sync [--scope tasks|habits|pomo|full]
omarchy-ticktick add "Pay rent" --due today [--project ID] [--priority 0|1|3|5] [--tags work,ops]
omarchy-ticktick update <taskId> [--title T] [--due D|+N|none] [--keep-time] [--priority P] [--tags a,b] [--project ID]
omarchy-ticktick complete <taskId>
omarchy-ticktick reopen <taskId>
omarchy-ticktick delete <taskId>
omarchy-ticktick checkin "Read" --toggle    # by name or id
omarchy-ticktick checkin "Water" --value 3
omarchy-ticktick pomo status                # today's focus stats + settings
omarchy-ticktick pomo log --minutes 50      # upload a finished focus block
omarchy-ticktick status                     # cache state as JSON
omarchy-ticktick logout
```

Every command prints JSON on stdout and errors on stderr, so it scripts and
binds cleanly.

## Settings

The shell stores these on the widget's entry in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`; it has no form for plugin settings, so the
view, grouping and sorting are also changed from inside the panel, which
writes them back.

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `defaultView` | `Today` | What the panel opens on — see below. |
| `groupBy` | `Date` | `Date`, `List`, `Priority`, or `None`. `s` in the panel. |
| `sortBy` | `Due` | `Due`, `Priority`, `Title`, or `Manual`. `S` in the panel. |
| `includeOverdue` | `true` | List late work in the date ranges. The red dot shows it either way. |
| `barLabel` | `Icon` | `Icon` (glyph and dots), `Next` (plus the next task, scrolling), or `Count`. Right-click the widget to cycle it. |
| `dotOverdueColor` | `#e0443e` | The top dot. |
| `dotTodayColor` | `#3b82f6` | The middle dot. |
| `dotWeekColor` | `#22c55e` | The bottom dot. |
| `syncInterval` | `5 minutes` | `2 minutes`, `5 minutes`, `15 minutes`, `1 hour`, or `Only when opened`. |
| `showTasks` | `true` | Show the task section. |
| `showHabits` | `true` | Show the habit section. |
| `maxTasks` | `12` | Rows before the list is capped with a "+N more". |
| `notifyOnDue` | `false` | Notify when a task's time arrives. |
| `notifyLeadMinutes` | `0` | Notify this many minutes early instead. |
| `showPomo` | `true` | Focus section, and a live countdown in the bar. |
| `undoSeconds` | `6` | How long a completion is held before sending. `0` disables undo. |
| `pomoMinutes` | `0` | Focus length. `0` follows your TickTick account. |
| `shortBreakMinutes` | `0` | Short break. `0` follows your account. |
| `longBreakMinutes` | `0` | Long break. `0` follows your account. |
| `longBreakInterval` | `0` | Long break every N blocks. `0` follows your account. |

### `defaultView`

| Value | Shows |
|---|---|
| `Today` | due today, plus late work |
| `Tomorrow` | due tomorrow only |
| `Week` | today and the next six days, plus late work |
| `Month` | today and the next twenty-nine days, plus late work |
| `All` | every open task |
| `No date` | open tasks without a due date |
| `Inbox` | the Inbox, dated or not |
| `list:Work` | one list, dated or not — by name or id |
| `folder:Jobs` | every list in a folder — by name or id |

Names are matched without case and without a leading emoji, so `list:work`
finds `💼Work`. A list that is deleted or closed falls back to Today. Saving
from the panel stores the id (`list:6a55…`), so renaming the list later does
not break it. `horizon`, the upstream key, is still read if `defaultView` is
not set; its `Next 7 days` means `Week`.

```json
{ "id": "design-nexus.ticktick", "defaultView": "list:Work", "groupBy": "Priority" }
```

| Panel | `r` | sync now |
| Panel | `p` | start or pause focus |
| Panel | `d` / `del` | discard the focus block (not logged) |
| Panel | `g` / `G` | first / last row |
| Panel | `tab` | next bar panel |
| Panel | `?` | show or hide the shortcut list |
| Panel | `esc` | back out one layer — help, picker, row actions, undo — then close |

IPC, for keybindings:

```bash
omarchy-shell design-nexus.ticktick toggle
omarchy-shell design-nexus.ticktick sync
omarchy-shell design-nexus.ticktick focus       # start or pause a block
omarchy-shell design-nexus.ticktick focusStop   # discard it
omarchy-shell design-nexus.ticktick cycleLabel  # icon / count / next task
```

`toggle`, `open`, `close`, `show`, and `hide` open the panel on the monitor
Hyprland currently has focused. `sync` goes to every instance.

## Tests

```bash
node --test tests/model.test.js
python3 tests/test_cli.py
```

CI runs the same suite on every push to `master` and every pull request,
along with a compile check of the CLI and a parse of `manifest.json`.

`Model.js` holds every piece of logic that can be wrong without being
visibly wrong — timezone handling on all-day due dates, streak counting
across a day that is still open, overdue sorting — so it is plain JS with no
QML imports and runs under node.

What a notification decides — which moment fires, once, and what the popup
says — is in there too. That it actually reaches the desktop is one D-Bus
call away from being observable, so check it directly rather than by waiting
for 14:30:

```bash
dbus-monitor --session "interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications',member='Notify'"
```

With that running, add a task due a minute ago and force a sync — the call
should appear once, and not again when the shell restarts:

```bash
bin/omarchy-ticktick add "Test" --due today --time $(date -d '1 min ago' +%H:%M)
bin/omarchy-ticktick sync
```

The CLI tests exercise state-changing request paths with an isolated fake
session, so they never read account credentials or contact TickTick.

## Background sync

The interval is a short list rather than a number field, because the useful
range is narrow and the costs are not obvious:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `2 minutes` | for a busy shared list; the most this should ever poll |
| `5 minutes` | the default |
| `15 minutes` | fine for a personal list |
| `1 hour` | you mostly add tasks rather than watch them |
| `Only when opened` | no background polling at all |

Opening the panel always syncs, and so do the sync button and `r`, so this
setting governs only the idle case — how fresh the bar's count is while you
are not looking at it.

Two things make a short list better than a free-form seconds box here. Each
tick is five HTTP requests, and **a bar surface exists per monitor**, so a
two-screen desktop fires the timer twice. To keep that from doubling the
traffic, a timer-driven sync passes `--max-age`: whichever instance gets
there first does the work, and the second sees a fresh cache and exits
without a request. Explicit syncs never skip, and neither does a sync with
anything queued in the outbox.

```bash
omarchy-ticktick sync --max-age 285   # what the timer runs
```

`Only when opened` still syncs once shortly after the shell starts —
otherwise the bar would show a stale count until you first clicked it.

## Due notifications

Off by default. Turn `notifyOnDue` on and the desktop says so when a task's
time arrives, through `notify-send` — the count in the bar is something you
have to look at, and this is the half that comes to you.

```json
{ "id": "design-nexus.ticktick", "notifyOnDue": true, "notifyLeadMinutes": 10 }
```

What it announces, and what it deliberately does not:

| | |
|---|---|
| A task with a time | at that time, or `notifyLeadMinutes` before it |
| A task with a duration | when it **starts** — a meeting `8:30–9:30` arrives at 8:30, not as it ends |
| A task with a date but no time | never: its due "time" is midnight, which is not a moment worth waking anyone for |
| Several at once | one notification listing them, not one popup each |

Whether a task got a time at all is visible as you type it: the quick-add
field shows `Today · 21:00` when it took the clock, and plain `Today` when it
did not — which is the difference between a reminder that fires and one that
never does.

It rides the clock the bar already runs, so nothing new polls: the check is a
pass over the cached task list once a minute, and the only process it ever
starts is `notify-send` itself, and only when there is something new to say. A
sync that pulls in a task that is already due announces it there and then,
rather than holding it to the next minute boundary.

Two things keep it from repeating itself or shouting. What has been announced
is keyed on the **moment**, not the task — a recurring task rolls its due date
forward and earns a fresh reminder, and so does one you reschedule — and that
record is written to
`~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus/notified.json`, because the shell restarts on
every theme or config change and an in-memory record would announce your 14:30
meeting again at 14:31. And a moment is only announced within an hour of
passing: a laptop that was asleep all morning tells you about the last hour,
not about all of it, and never about yesterday.

The cache is what it reads, so a task completed elsewhere can still be
announced if it comes due inside the sync interval — the notification is as
fresh as the count in the bar beside it. Completing a task here suppresses its
notification immediately, and it stays suppressed while the completion waits
out its undo window, even if a sync lands in the meantime.

That cuts both ways, and it is the one thing worth setting up deliberately: a
reminder can only be as current as your last sync. With **Background sync** set
to `Only when opened`, the cache is refreshed once at startup and then only
when you open the panel, so a task you added on your phone this morning may
never be announced at all. If you want reminders you can rely on, leave
background sync on an interval shorter than the notice you expect.

Switching notifications on does not replay the morning at you. The first check
after you switch them on — for the first time, or off and on again — remembers
whatever is already past as announced without showing it, because nothing can
have been missed before the feature was armed. A reminder whose lead time has
started but whose moment is still ahead is not past, and goes out as usual. A
shell restart is the other case: it catches up on what came due while the shell
was down, within the hour, which is what the record on disk is for.

If `notify-send` is missing or no notification daemon is listening, nothing is
recorded as announced, so the reminders are still waiting once you install one
rather than having been quietly used up.

## Why writes feel immediate

A write costs a sync, and a full sync is five HTTP round trips — about two
seconds. Adding a task cannot change your habits, your check-ins, or your
pomodoro settings, so re-fetching them afterwards spends most of that second
confirming that nothing happened.

Syncs are therefore scoped. A task write refreshes tasks only, a check-in
refreshes habits only, and a finished focus block refreshes the pomodoro
stats. Sections outside the scope keep their cached values.

```bash
omarchy-ticktick sync --scope tasks     # ~0.6s, vs ~2.0s for full
```

On top of that, a quick-added task appears in the list the moment you press
enter, before the request completes. The next cache write replaces it with
the real one. The placeholder row is inert — it has no id yet, so it cannot
be completed by accident.

## Offline

A write made while TickTick is unreachable is not lost and not silently
dropped. It goes into an outbox at
`~/.local/state/omarchy/ticktick-plus/outbox.json`, and the change is applied to
the local cache immediately — so the task appears in the list, the habit
shows checked, and both survive a shell restart rather than living only in
the panel's memory.

Every sync drains the queue before reading anything back, so what you get
afterwards reflects your writes instead of contradicting them. The panel
shows a cloud and a count while anything is waiting; clicking it retries.

This is safe to replay because **every write carries a client-generated id** —
tasks, check-in entries, and pomodoro records alike. Sending a queued write
twice updates the same record instead of creating a duplicate.

Replays resolve against current server state rather than being sent verbatim.
A v2 update is a whole-object write, so a queued completion re-fetches the
task and changes only its status; anything you edited on another device in
the meantime survives. Queued check-ins re-query the day's entry before
deciding whether to add or update it.

A write that TickTick actively *rejects* is dropped rather than retried
forever, since replaying a rejection only earns another rejection. A write
that never got a verdict — no network, or a rate limit — is kept and retried.
When the queue stalls, the remaining entries stay in order instead of each
one hammering a dead network.

```bash
omarchy-ticktick status     # includes the queued count
```

## Quick add

The field takes more than a title:

```
Renew the TLS cert #work !1 tomorrow
```

| Syntax | Does | Whose convention |
|---|---|---|
| `#tag` | attaches a tag, lowercased | TickTick's — `#` is what its apps use |
| `!1` `!2` `!3` | priority: high, medium, low | this plugin's |
| `!high` `!med` `!low` | the same, spelled out | this plugin's |
| trailing `today` / `tomorrow` / `yesterday` / `2026-09-01` | sets the due date | TickTick parses dates from text too |
| trailing `21:00` / `9pm` / `9 pm` / `9:30am` | sets a due hour | TickTick parses times too |
| trailing `21:00-22:30` / `9am-5pm` | sets a duration — both ends must be clocks; an end not after the start spills into the next day | this plugin's |
| `shift+enter` on `gym 6 - 7am` | takes the range the hint offers, as `gym 6am-7am` | this plugin's |
| `on` `for` `due` `by` before either; `at` and `@` before a clock; `@` attached to a day (`@tomorrow`) | filler; goes with the date, not the title | TickTick swallows these too |

Everything not consumed becomes the title, so the line above creates *Renew
the TLS cert*, tagged `work`, high priority, due tomorrow. With no syntax at
all it is a plain task due today.

Editing pre-fills the field with the line that would have created the task —
including its times — so a duration survives an edit by riding along in the
line. Delete the clock from the line and the duration is deleted with it;
the line is always the whole truth.

TickTick has no quick-add symbol for priority — it is still an open request
on their forum — so `!` is defined here rather than borrowed. `#` and the
date words match what TickTick already taught you.

Five details worth knowing:

- A date word only counts at the **end**. `Plan today standup` keeps its
  word; `Standup notes for today` does not, and the preposition goes with the
  date rather than being left dangling. `at` and `@` do the same in front of
  a clock, so `Call mum at 9pm` is a call at nine, not a task called
  "Call mum at" — but not in front of a day, where they usually end a title:
  `Look at today` is a task called *Look at*.
- A duration is a hyphen between two **clocks**. In `gym 6 - 7 am` the `6` is
  a number, not six o'clock, so the line stays in the title and the hint says
  the time was not recognised, rather than the task landing at 07:00 — the end
  of the block — called "gym 6 -". `to`, `till` and an en dash read the same
  way. The glued `gym 6 - 7am` is still read as it always was, because
  `Level 3 - 9pm` has the same shape and is a real title with a real time;
  the hint then names the task, `called “gym 6 -”`, so a half-read range
  shows before enter. Either way a second line under the field offers the
  range — `⇧ enter → 06:00–07:00` — and **shift+enter** takes it, rewriting
  the line to `gym 6am-7am` before it is added. Tags or priority after the
  range come along, a day written in front of it is named
  (`⇧ enter → Tomorrow 06:00–07:00`), and a block may run past midnight
  (`shift 11 - 7am`). A full range the grammar reads implausibly gets the
  likelier reading offered too: `call 1:30-2pm` is read as 01:30 to 14:00, a
  twelve-and-a-half-hour block, and shift+enter offers 13:30–14:00. Plain
  enter never guesses.
- The line under the field says what it understood — `Today · 21:00`, or
  just `Today` when you typed no time. A clock it would not take says so —
  `Today · time not recognised` — and the words stay in the title, so the task
  lands all-day and never notifies. When an edit would change a task's name,
  the hint leads with `Renaming to “…”`. The hint is how you see all of that
  before enter, rather than after.
- An unrecognised `!token` is left alone in the title.
- Tags are lowercased, because that is the key tasks reference them by.

The same syntax is listed under `?` in the panel.

### Editing uses the same line

Press `e` on the selected task and the field fills with the line that would
have created it — `Renew the cert #work !1 tomorrow`. Change it, press enter,
and the task becomes what the line says. Escape cancels.

So there is no separate editor and no second syntax: what you type to make a
task is what you edit to change it. Removal falls out of that — delete
`#work` from the line and the tag is gone, drop `!1` and the priority clears.
A date is applied only when the line carries one, so an undated task stays
undated.

## Views

The panel opens on `defaultView`. Everything you do to it after that —
choosing another view, filtering — is a look, not a setting: closing the
panel returns it to the default and clears the filters. The ★ in the header
is filled when you are on the default, and clicking it (or `D`) makes the
current view the default.

The title is the picker. It lists the date ranges and smart lists, then the
Inbox, then your lists in TickTick's sidebar order, with folders as headings
over their lists; choosing a folder shows all of its lists together. `V`
steps through Today → Week → Month without opening it.

Date ranges are rolling: Week is today and the next six days, Month today
and the next twenty-nine, the same shape as TickTick's "Next 7 Days". Lists
show undated tasks too, after the dated ones, because a list view should
show the whole list.

A task you just created is never filed out of sight. Adding
`Ship the release 2026-10-20` from Today widens the view to the range that
shows it. A list view already shows every date, so it stays put, and a task
added there lands in that list rather than the Inbox.

Late is a day, not an hour. A task due at 10:30 is still today's work at
18:00 — it turns late at midnight. Grouped by date, late work has its own
heading with its count, newest slip first; grouped any other way, the count
moves to the section header so it is never hidden.

### Row actions

`m`, or a right-click on a row, opens a strip of chips under it:

- **Today / Tomorrow / +7 days / No date** — the task keeps its time of day,
  the way TickTick's date menu does; a 09:30 call moved to tomorrow is at
  09:30 tomorrow.
- **Pick date…** borrows the add field and reads it with the quick-add date
  grammar: `2026-10-02`, `tomorrow 9am`, `today 14:00-15:00`.
- **Move to…** opens the picker in move mode. Moves go through TickTick's own
  move call (`/batch/taskProject`); a whole-object update carrying a new list
  is accepted and ignored.
- **None / Low / Med / High** sets the priority; the current one is outlined.

These go out immediately rather than through the undo window — each is its
own undo — and while offline they queue like every other write.

## Long titles

A title wider than the row is elided — until you point at it. **The row under
the mouse, or under the keyboard cursor, scrolls to reveal the rest**, pauses
at the end, and slides back.

Only that one row moves. A list where every long title animates at once cannot
be scanned, and scanning is what the list is for. Nothing scrolls until you
show interest in a specific row, and a row that stops mid-scroll returns home
rather than sitting half off the edge.

The bar behaves the same way in `Next` mode, where the label is a task title:
it scrolls rather than being cut at 28 characters, and pauses at each end
instead of wrapping around. A continuous wrap — the way the media widget
scrolls a track name — leaves the bar slot looking empty for part of every
loop, which a track name can afford and a task reminder cannot. Reading speed
is constant in both places, so a longer title takes longer rather than moving
faster.

The slot keeps a fixed width in `Next` mode. A bar item that resized with
every task title would shove its neighbours sideways each time you completed
something.

## Colours

TickTick stores a colour for **tags** and **lists**. Tag colours show as a
dot beside the task title, and list colours as a dot in the picker.

The bar's three dots are fixed red, blue and green, overridable with the
`dot*Color` settings. The Omarchy theme has no red, blue or green roles — only
an accent and an urgent colour — and three dots in one colour could not say
which is which.

Inside the panel, due state still follows the theme: overdue takes the accent
colour, today normal foreground, anything later is muted. Priority shows as
bold for high, and as the outlined chip in the row actions.

## Undo, and why it is a delay

Completing a task or checking a habit in does not fire immediately. The
action is held for `undoSeconds`, an undo row appears, and only when the
window lapses is anything sent. Closing the panel sends everything still held
— closing is not a cancel.

Held actions are a **stack**, not a single slot. Ticking four things off in a
row is how a list actually gets cleared, and holding only the newest would
mean the first three were already gone by the time you noticed the mistake —
the undo window would fail exactly where mistakes cluster. Each action keeps
its own countdown, `u` takes back the most recent, and pressing it repeatedly
walks back through them. The row shows how many are behind the one on offer
(`+2 more`).

It works this way because the alternative does not work. TickTick's own
completion flow rolls a *recurring* task forward and records the finished
occurrence separately, so a later `reopen` cannot put that transaction back.
An undo that never sends the request is the only one that is actually
reversible.

### Recurring tasks

TickTick does not roll a recurring task forward on its server. Its own web
client does it in two writes: it adds a *new* task holding the finished
occurrence, and updates the live series back to not-done with its dates moved
on. A generic v2 update sending only `status = 2` therefore does not complete
an occurrence — it ends the series, and every future repetition with it.

So completing a recurring task here sends that same pair in one `batch/task`
call. The finished occurrence is a copy with a fresh id, its recurrence
fields cleared and `repeatTaskId` pointing back at the series. The series
keeps its id, stays open, and its start and due dates move by whole days in
the task's own timezone — so a 9am task is still at 9am after the clocks
change, and a duration survives the move. Subtask ticks, progress and focus
summaries reset, because last week's are not this week's.

That means the next occurrence date is computed here rather than by TickTick,
which is the one part of this that can be silently wrong. It covers the
repeats TickTick's picker builds: `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY` and `YEARLY`
with an interval, `BYDAY` (including ordinals like `3MO` and `-1FR`),
`BYMONTHDAY` (including `-1` for month-end), `BYMONTH`, `COUNT`, `UNTIL`, and
"repeat from the day I finish". Anything else — TickTick's non-RFC `ERULE`
repeats, lunar calendars, Ebbinghaus spacing, a series with no due date — is
refused with a message rather than guessed at, and stays completable in
TickTick. A refusal costs you one trip to another app; a wrong date silently
reschedules a real task.

An occurrence you skipped in TickTick is not landed on again: the series'
excluded dates are read and stepped over rather than rolled back onto. A
subtask carrying a date of its own moves by the same number of days, so it
does not read as overdue the moment the task rolls over.

A last occurrence completes plainly: an exhausted `COUNT` or a next date past
`UNTIL` has nothing to roll forward, so it becomes an ordinary completion.
Reopening is unchanged throughout — it never rolled anything forward.

The finished occurrence does not carry the series' attachments. Those are
server-side files owned by the live task, and pointing two records at one
upload is worse than a completed copy without them.

## Focus timer

TickTick's pomodoro is client-side. There is no server-side running clock to
join, so this plugin runs its own and uploads each completed block through
`POST /batch/pomodoro` — the same thing TickTick's apps do. Your durations,
break lengths, long-break interval, and daily goal are read from the account
(`/user/preferences/pomodoro`), so the rhythm matches the phone app.

Durations are settable per widget. Each of `pomoMinutes`,
`shortBreakMinutes`, `longBreakMinutes`, and `longBreakInterval` defaults to
`0`, meaning "use whatever TickTick says" — so the panel tracks your account
until you deliberately disagree with it, and only the fields you set are
overridden:

```json
{ "id": "design-nexus.ticktick", "pomoMinutes": 25, "longBreakInterval": 3 }
```

While a block runs the bar shows the countdown instead of the task count.
Stopping a block early does **not** log it: TickTick counts a pomodoro on
completion, and banking partial blocks would inflate the statistics this is
meant to keep honest.

## Limitations

- No renaming lists, no subtasks added from here, no drag reordering — do
  those in TickTick.
- The picker shows lists and folders, not TickTick's custom filters or tag
  views; filter by tag with `f` instead.
- Habit check-ins are all-or-step. Arbitrary values need `--value`.
- One account.
- Due notifications need a task to carry a time.
- The focus timer lives in the shell process. Restarting the shell loses a
  running block.
